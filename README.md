# P4wnP1-Scripts
This is a repository with self written Scripts for the P4wnP1

P4wnP1 Repository: https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa

Latest Releases: https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa/releases

Wich Folder to use.

In the Standard folder you can find Scripts that are used on 
Windows 10 Computers on wich there are now restrictions regarding Powershell and
the Run application.

In the GUI R LOCKED you can find scripts wich dont use the Run application
or the Powershell. These can be used at Restricted computers.

In the Trigger folder you can find every Script that is set to run as a
Trigger application.

You may have to code.
The scripts are currently written so that they work on Computers I am using.
If you have a computer that is very slow you may want to change some delays so
that the timings are right for your computers. 

In every script the layout is currently set to German. So you may want to change
layout('de') to layout('fr') or layout('us').
Basically every language you need it to be. layout('your language').
You can find all supported languages on the P4wnP1 repository linked at the top.

I want to advise you that this scripts are not for doing illegal stuff.
These scripts are meant to be used for legal Pentesting or for a prank 
on a friend who agrees with you doing stuff like that.

Have Fun
